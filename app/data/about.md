#### Intro

I've been a resident of Santa Monica for over 15 years. My journey in web development began last year when I started to prepare for coding bootcamp at UCLA.  Prior to this I was interested in technology and it's uses primarily in photography by creating high-end digital and analog images for clients in Los Angeles and beyond.  Some of my clients include Taschen, teNeuse, Next, Wilhelmina, and LA Models.

Attracted by the use of creativity and technology, I entered the world of tech to expand my expertise. I enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp at UCLA.  At bootcamp, I had the opportunity to be mentored by senior developers and solidify my understanding of many best-practices and important programming concepts.

#### Currently 
Looking to start at a company to continue my journey as a full-time Web Developer.  I'm currently earning additional certifications in Javascript, CSS, Node and React to enhance a deeper understanding of these technologies.
