#### Intro

I arrived in Santa Monica by way of Manila, New York and Boston. My interest in web development began last year when I started to prepare for coding bootcamp at UCLA.  Prior to this I was already interested in the use of technology primarily in photography creating high-end digital and analog images for clients in Los Angeles and beyond.  
<br><br>
I got into Web Development to expand my expertise so I enrolled in a Web Development Immersive program at UCLA.  At bootcamp, I had the opportunity to be mentored by senior developers and solidify my understanding of many best-practices and important programming concepts.
<br><br>
#### Some tools I've used

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, NodeJs, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handelbars & ReactJS.
<br><br>
#### Currently 
Looking to start at a company to continue my journey as a full-time Web Developer.  I'm currently earning additional certifications in Javascript, CSS, Node and React to enhance a deeper understanding of these technologies.
